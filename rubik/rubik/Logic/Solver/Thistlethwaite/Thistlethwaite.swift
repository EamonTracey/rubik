enum Thistlethwaite {
    /*
     * Each step of Thistlethwaite's method has 2 constants: factor and allowedTurns.
     * The factor constant refers to the factor by which the step reduces the space
     * of cube states. Each step's lookup table will have a number of entries equal
     * to that state's corresponding factor. The allowedTurns constant refers to the
     * set of turns used in each step. In the graph traversals, we will traverse only
     * those edges that correspond to the step.
